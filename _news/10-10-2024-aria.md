We have a new funded project: __Graded Modal Types for Higher-order Probabilistic Programming__ funded by ARIA as part of their [Safeguarded AI TA1.1 programme](https://www.aria.org.uk/opportunity-spaces/mathematics-for-safe-ai/safeguarded-ai/) with Vineet Rajani as Principle Investigator and Dominic Orchard as Co-Investigator.
Funded by this project, [David Binder](https://binderdavid.github.io/) is joining us in the new year as a post doctoral Reserach Associate. Watch this space for results!
