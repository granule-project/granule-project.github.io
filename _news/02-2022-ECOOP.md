Daniel and Dominic have a pearl accepted to [ECOOP 2022](https://2022.ecoop.org) on how linear functions consuming values can be understood algebraically as a multiplicative inverse to the type of those values, discussing some of the applications using both Haskell and Granule. This paper won a **Distinguished Paper Award** and a **Distinguished Artifact Award**.
