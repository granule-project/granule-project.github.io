Daniel and Dominic have a pearl accepted for presentation at [ECOOP 2022](https://2022.ecoop.org) on how linear functions consuming values can be understood algebraically as a multiplicative inverse to the type of those values, discussing some of the applications using both Haskell and Granule.

- [__How to Take the Inverse of a Type__](http://granule-project.github.io/papers/ecoop22-paper.pdf) (Daniel Marshall and Dominic Orchard).
