Meeting on Graded Types in Programming
------------------------------

Graded type systems can be understood broadly as
 imbuing type systems with additional information that follows the underlying structure of a program or proof.
This idea has grown considerably in recent years with various forms of graded type system being developed, for example, from generalisations of effect
systems (modelled by graded monads), coeffect systems (modelled by graded comonads), quantitative type theories that generalise ideas from bounded
linear logic, graded modal systems, contextual modal type theory, capability tracking systems, graded session types, adjoint logic and multi modal systems.
In practical settings, graded type systems are becoming more prevalent, e.g., Granule, Idris 2, Haskell (via the LinearType extension).

The aim of this meeting is to bring together a wide variety of researchers working on such concepts across programming language theory and practice.
