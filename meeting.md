Meeting on Graded Types
------------------------

<span style='font-size:larger'>17th June 2022 - School of Computing, University of Kent (+ online)</span>

Graded type systems can be understood broadly as
 imbuing type systems with additional information that follows the underlying structure of a program or proof.
This idea has grown considerably in recent years with various forms of graded type system being developed, for example, from generalisations of effect
systems (modelled by graded monads), coeffect systems (modelled by graded comonads), quantitative type theories that generalise ideas from bounded
linear logic, graded modal systems, contextual modal type theory, capability tracking systems, graded session types, adjoint logic and multi modal systems.
In practical settings, graded type systems are becoming more prevalent, e.g., Granule, Idris 2, Haskell (via the LinearTypes extension).

The aim of this meeting is to bring together a wide variety of researchers working on such concepts across programming language theory and practice to report on latest work and share ideas. The hope is that this can be a pre-cursor to future such meetings, e.g., a Dagstuhl seminar.

### Schedule

This is a hybrid event. You can attend in person or online. On Thursday afternoon, there is a separate
but related event running, hosted by David Corfield, that all are welcome to attend as part of this:

- **Thursday 16th afternoon - Grading in Philosophy, Logic, Linguistics and Computer Science**

    - [Daniel Lassiter](http://web.stanford.edu/~danlass/) (University of Edinburgh)
    - [David Corfield](https://www.kent.ac.uk/philosophy/people/1689/corfield-david) (University of Kent)
    - [Dominic Orchard](https://granule-project.github.io) (University of Kent and University of Cambridge)

- **Friday 17th - Meeting on Graded Types**

    - [Harley Eades](https://metatheorem.org/), A Mixed Linear and Graded Logic 
    - Pritam Choudhury
    - [Dylan McDermott](https://dylanm.org/)
    - [Edwin Brady](https://www.type-driven.org.uk/edwinb/)
    - [Jean-Philippe Bernardy](https://jyp.github.io/)

    - + session of shorter talks (10 minutes)

Schedule TBD, but likely to last most of the day. 

### Signing up and attending in person

- [Sign up here](https://forms.gle/yYPp7kodQ8478nSZA)
- Please tick 'In person' if you would like to attend in person on the form.
- The School of Computing at the University of Kent is [about 30 minute walk from Canterbury West station](https://www.google.com/maps/dir/canterbury+west/Cornwallis+South+East+(Octagon),+University+Of+Kent,+St+Stephen's+Hill,+Canterbury+CT2+7NL/@51.2914835,1.0652968,15z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m14!4m13!1m5!1m1!1s0x47decbb6b38183cb:0x578821196fcdcd35!2m2!1d1.07533!2d51.28427!1m5!1m1!1s0x47decba874d2f7c7:0x6d4d3c9d25aaf5da!2m2!1d1.07126!2d51.2988783!3e2?hl=en), which is a bit less than an hour on the train from St. Pancras
- There is a lot of accommodation nearby if you want to stay overnight. One recommendation is [Acacia Lodge](https://www.acacialodge.co.uk/) (which is near to the train station and again about 30 minutes walk from campus) or the [Beverly Farmhouse](https://www.kent.ac.uk/conferences-and-events/holidays/beverley-farmhouse) (which is on campus).

- Any questions please contact [Dominic Orchard](mailto:d.a.orchard@kent.ac.uk).
