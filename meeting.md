Meeting on Graded Types
------------------------

<span style='font-size:larger'>17th June 2022 - University of Kent</span>

Graded type systems can be understood broadly as
 imbuing type systems with additional information that follows the underlying structure of a program or proof.
This idea has grown considerably in recent years with various forms of graded type system being developed, for example, from generalisations of effect
systems (modelled by graded monads), coeffect systems (modelled by graded comonads), quantitative type theories that generalise ideas from bounded
linear logic, graded modal systems, contextual modal type theory, capability tracking systems, graded session types, adjoint logic and multi modal systems.
In practical settings, graded type systems are becoming more prevalent, e.g., Granule, Idris 2, Haskell (via the LinearTypes extension).

The aim of this meeting is to bring together a wide variety of researchers working on such concepts across programming language theory and practice to report on latest work and share ideas. The hope is that this can be a pre-cursor to future such meetings, e.g., a Dagstuhl seminar.
